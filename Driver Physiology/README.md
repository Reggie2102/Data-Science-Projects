This project focuses on analyzing physiological signals collected from drivers to assess their emotional and cognitive states. 
The dataset includes continuous measurements such as heart rate, body temperature, and SpOâ‚‚ (oxygen saturation), along with labeled mood states. 
Monitoring driver physiology is essential for developing driver monitoring systems (DMS) that enhance road safety and reduce fatigue-related accidents.
The primary objective is to clean and preprocess the sensor data, explore physiological patterns, and build machine learning models to classify driver moods or stress levels based on biometric signals.
