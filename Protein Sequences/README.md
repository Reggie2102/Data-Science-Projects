# Protein Structure Dataset Analysis
## Overview

This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling on a large protein dataset retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). The dataset contains structural and sequence data for over 400,000 proteins, making it valuable for bioinformatics, drug discovery, and structural biology research.

## Context
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a globally recognized repository of 3D structural data for large biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Structures in the PDB are determined using advanced techniques such as:

X-ray crystallography
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
This repository supports the biological and pharmaceutical research communities in understanding molecular mechanisms, disease pathways, and drug interactions.
