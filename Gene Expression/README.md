# Gene Expression â€“ Bioinformatics Dataset

## Overview

This project analyzes a gene expression dataset ideal for **dimensionality reduction**, **clustering**, and **classification**. Gene expression data plays a vital role in disease detection, biomarker discovery, and personalized medicine. By applying unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and predict biological classifications.
