# Promoter Region Prediction Dataset
## About the Dataset
Promoters are critical DNA sequences located near the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. They play a vital role in regulating gene expression by influencing the binding of RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcription.

This dataset is intended to support supervised machine learning models for predicting promoter regions in DNA sequences. Promoter prediction is a challenging task in bioinformatics and is crucial for understanding gene regulation, identifying functional elements in genomes, and advancing synthetic biology.

## Objective
The objective of this dataset is to enable the recognition of promoter regions in genomic sequences using machine learning. Accurate promoter prediction helps in:

Genome annotation

Gene regulatory network construction

Understanding transcriptional mechanisms

## Feature Categories
To build accurate models, the dataset includes features extracted from three key domains:

1.  CpG Islands
Regions of DNA with a high frequency of CG dinucleotides

Often associated with gene regulatory elements

CpG-rich regions are common in promoter areas

2.  Structural Features
DNA shape and bending profiles

Thermodynamic stability

Helix twist, roll, and tilt parameters

3.  Content Features
Nucleotide composition (A, T, G, C ratios)

k-mer frequencies

Sequence motifs known to associate with promoters

## Research Applications
This dataset supports the development and benchmarking of Promoter Prediction Programs (PPPs) using supervised learning. It is well-suited for:

Binary classification: promoter vs. non-promoter
